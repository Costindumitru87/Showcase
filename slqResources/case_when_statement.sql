### Basic CASE statement example
-- Identify the home team as Bayern Munich, Schalke 04, or neither
SELECT 
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 10189 THEN 'FC Schalke 04'
        WHEN hometeam_id = 9823 THEN 'FC Bayern Munich'
         ELSE 'Other' END AS home_team,
	COUNT(id) AS total_matches
FROM matches_germany
GROUP BY home_team;


### Filtering a CASE statement example
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE 
    CASE WHEN a > 5 THEN 'Keep'
         WHEN a <= 5 THEN 'Exclude' 
         END = 'Keep';
         
         
### Calculating percent with CASE and AVG example
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Rounding the percentage of tied games to 2 decimal points
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			 WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
			 END),2) AS pct_ties_2013_2014,
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			 WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
			 END),2) AS pct_ties_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
